# CI/CD Test

This file was created to test the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline integration with GitHub pull requests.

## Expected Behavior
When this change is submitted as a pull request to the main branch, Jenkins should automatically:
1. Build the application
2. Run unit tests
3. Generate a SonarQube analysis report

This test is for the ENSF 400 Course Project - Checkin 2 requirements.
