## Repository Setup

- **Public Repository:**  
  This repository is public to allow all team members to contribute.
  
- **Team Participation:**  
  All team members are added as collaborators. Contributions are documented in the Team Members section.

## Git Workflow & Collaboration

We follow the GitHub Flow with these practices:

1. **Branching Strategy:**  
   - All development work happens on feature branches created from the `main` branch.
   - Feature branch names follow the pattern: `feature/<description>` (e.g., `feature/add-ci-pipeline`).

2. **Pull Requests (PRs):**  
   - Once a feature is complete, a pull request is created against `main`.
   - Each PR requires at least one peer review and must pass CI checks before merging.
   - The `main` branch is protected so that only tested and reviewed code is merged.

3. **Code Reviews:**  
   - Team members review PRs, leave feedback, and request changes.
   - Any requested changes should be committed on the same branch.
   - Once approved, the feature branch is merged into `main`.

4. **Merging:**  
   - After approvals and successful CI, the PR is merged, and feature branches are optionally deleted.

## Containerization

*Details for Docker containerization will be added in the next stage.*

## CI/CD Pipeline

*Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline configuration will be detailed and integrated shortly.*

## Testing & Code Quality

*Automated tests and quality reports (e.g., SonarQube and JMeter) will be included.*

## Documentation & Demo

*Comprehensive documentation and a demo video (≤ 10 minutes) will be provided, showcasing the complete workflow and individual contributions.*
